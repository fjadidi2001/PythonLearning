Logical expressions in Python are used to combine conditional statements and typically involve the use of logical operators. Python provides three main logical operators:

1. **and**
2. **or**
3. **not**

### 1. Logical `and`

The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`. If either of the operands is `False`, it returns `False`.

```python
a = True
b = False

result = a and b  # result will be False
print(result)  # Output: False

a = 3
b = 5
result = a < 5 and b > 3  # True (3 < 5) and (5 > 3)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

### 2. Logical `or`

The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. It only returns `False` if both operands are `False`.

```python
a = True
b = False

result = a or b  # result will be True
print(result)  # Output: True

x = 10
y = 20
result = x < 5 or y > 15  # True (10 < 5 is False, 20 > 15 is True)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

### 3. Logical `not`

The `not` operator negates the truth value of the operand. If the operand is `True`, `not` will return `False`, and vice versa.

```python
a = True
result = not a  # result will be False
print(result)  # Output: False

b = False
result = not b  # result will be True
print(result)  # Output: True
```

### Combining Logical Expressions

You can combine multiple logical expressions using the logical operators:

```python
age = 25
is_student = True

# Check if the person is either underage or a student
if age < 18 or is_student:
    print("You qualify for a student discount.")
else:
    print("You do not qualify for a discount.")
```

### Truthiness in Python

In addition to using `True` and `False`, Python has an implicit concept of truthiness. Certain values are considered `False` in a boolean context:

- The number `0` (zero)
- Empty collections (like `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `''`)
- `None`

Any other value will be considered `True`.

Example:
```python
value = []

if not value:
    print("Value is empty.")  # This will be printed because an empty list is considered False.
```

### Summary

Logical expressions in Python allow you to create complex conditions by combining multiple boolean expressions, which logical operators can control. Understanding how these operators work is crucial for writing conditional statements and controlling the flow of your programs.
