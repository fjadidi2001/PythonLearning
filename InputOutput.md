In Python, you can use built-in functions to handle input and output operations. The most common functions for these purposes are `input()` for input and `print()` for output.

### Input Command: `input()`

The `input()` function is used to take input from the user. It reads a line from the input (typically from the keyboard), and returns it as a string.

#### Syntax:
```python
input(prompt)
```

- `prompt`: (optional) A string that is displayed to the user to indicate what input is expected.

#### Example:
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

### Important Note:
- The value returned by `input()` is always of the string type. If you need it as a different type (like `int` or `float`), you will have to cast it explicitly.
  
```python
age = input("Enter your age: ")
age = int(age)  # Convert the input to an integer
print("You are", age, "years old.")
```

### Output Command: `print()`

The `print()` function is used to output data to the console.

#### Syntax:
```python
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
```

- `*objects`: The values to be printed (can be multiple).
- `sep`: (optional) The string inserted between the values. Default is a space (' ').
- `end`: (optional) The string appended after the last value. Default is a newline ('\n').
- `file`: (optional) An object with a `write(string)` method. The default is `sys.stdout`.
- `flush`: (optional) A boolean which, when set to True, forces the output to be flushed.

#### Example:
```python
print("Hello, World!")  # Simple output
print("The sum of 2 and 3 is", 2 + 3)  # Output with multiple arguments
```

### Advanced Output Formatting

You can format output using formatted strings (f-strings), the `format()` method, or using percentage formatting.

#### Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")
```

#### Using `format()`:
```python
name = "Bob"
age = 25
print("{} is {} years old.".format(name, age))
```

#### Using Percentage Formatting:
```python
name = "Charlie"
age = 22
print("%s is %d years old." % (name, age))
```

### Complete Example:
Here's a complete example that combines both input and output commands:

```python
# Getting user input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
age = int(age)  # Convert age to an integer

# Printing the output
print(f"{name}, you are {age} years old.")
```

### Summary:
- Use `input()` to take input from the user and always be mindful that it returns a string.
- Use `print()` to output information, and explore different formatting methods to customize your output.
