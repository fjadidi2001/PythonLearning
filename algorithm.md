> An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. It is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions that, when followed, will lead to the desired outcome or solution. Algorithms can be expressed in various forms, including natural language, pseudocode, flowcharts, or programming languages.

Key characteristics of algorithms include:

1. **Finiteness**: An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.
2. **Definiteness**: Each step of the algorithm must be precisely defined and unambiguous.
3. **Input**: An algorithm can have zero or more inputs, which are the values needed to perform the computation.
4. **Output**: An algorithm produces one or more outputs, which are the results of the computation.
5. **Effectiveness**: The operations to be performed in the algorithm must be basic enough to be done in a finite amount of time.

Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and programming, as they provide a clear method for solving problems and performing tasks efficiently.
