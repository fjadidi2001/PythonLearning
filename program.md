> A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer how to perform specific tasks or solve particular problems. It is essentially an implementation of an algorithm, translated into a format that a computer can understand and execute.

Key components of a program include:

1. **Source Code**: The human-readable instructions written in a programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++) that define the program's behavior.

2. **Compilation/Interpretation**: Depending on the programming language, the source code may need to be compiled (translated into machine code) or interpreted (executed line by line) for the computer to run it.

3. **Execution**: When a program is run, the computer follows the instructions in the source code to perform tasks, manipulate data, and produce output.

4. **Input and Output**: Programs often take input from users or other systems, process that input, and produce output, which can be displayed on the screen, saved to a file, or sent to another program.

5. **Logic and Control Structures**: Programs use various control structures (like loops, conditionals, and functions) to manage the flow of execution and make decisions based on input.

In summary, a program is a structured collection of instructions that enables a computer to perform specific functions, automate tasks, and solve problems.
