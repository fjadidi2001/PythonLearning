In Python, data types refer to the data type that a variable can hold. The most common built-in data types include integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and booleans. Sometimes, you'll need to convert data from one type to another, known as type conversion or typecasting.

There are two main types of type conversion in Python:

1. **Implicit Conversion** (or coercion): This is automatically performed by Python when you combine data of different types. For example, if you add an integer and a float, Python will implicitly convert the integer to a float before operating:

   ```python
   a = 5     # integer
   b = 3.2   # float
   result = a + b  # result is 8.2 (float)
   ```

2. **Explicit Conversion**: This is done manually by the programmer using built-in functions. There are several built-in functions for explicit type conversion:

   - `int()`: Converts a value to an integer.
   - `float()`: Converts a value to a float.
   - `str()`: Converts a value to a string.
   - `list()`: Converts a value (like a string or a tuple) to a list.
   - `tuple()`: Converts a value (like a list or a set) to a tuple.
   - `dict()`: Converts a sequence of key-value pairs to a dictionary.
   - `set()`: Converts a sequence or collection to a set.

### Examples of Explicit Type Conversion:

1. **Converting a Float to an Integer:**
   ```python
   num_float = 3.14
   num_int = int(num_float)  # num_int becomes 3 (truncated)
   ```

2. **Converting an Integer to a Float:**
   ```python
   num_int = 5
   num_float = float(num_int)  # num_float becomes 5.0
   ```

3. **Converting an Integer to a String:**
   ```python
   num_int = 10
   num_str = str(num_int)  # num_str becomes "10"
   ```

4. **Converting a String to an Integer:**
   ```python
   num_str = "20"
   num_int = int(num_str)  # num_int becomes 20
   ```

5. **Converting a String (with numbers) to a List:**
   ```python
   str_value = "hello"
   list_value = list(str_value)  # list_value becomes ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
   ```

### Important Notes:
- When converting from a string to an integer or float, make sure that the string represents a valid number. Otherwise, you will encounter a `ValueError`.
   ```python
   invalid_str = "abc"
   num_int = int(invalid_str)  # This will raise ValueError
   ```

- Some conversions may result in data loss, particularly when converting from float to int, as it truncates the decimal part.

Understanding and using type conversion properly is an essential part of Python programming, as it allows you to work with various types of data effectively.
