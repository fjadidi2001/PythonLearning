# set
store multiple items in a single var <br>
### 4 built-in data types 
<br>

- list
- tuple
- dictionary
- set

**A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.**
<br>
 Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
<br>
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
<br>
List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
<br>
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
<br>
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
<br>
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
<br>
**You can also use the pop() method to remove an item, but this method will remove a random item, so you cannot be sure what item that gets removed**
<br>
| method | data                                     |
| append() |	Adds an element at the end of the list |
| clear() |	Removes all the elements from the list |
copy()	Returns a copy of the list
count()	Returns the number of elements with the specified value
extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
index()	Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
pop()	Removes the element at the specified position
remove()	Removes the first item with the specified value
reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
sort()	Sorts the list

**Note: This page shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library, like the NumPy library.**
