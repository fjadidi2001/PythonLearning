**A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.**
<br>
 Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
<br>
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
<br>
List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
<br>
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
<br>
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
<br>
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
<br>
**You can also use the pop() method to remove an item, but this method will remove a random item, so you cannot be sure what item that gets removed**
